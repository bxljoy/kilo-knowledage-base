		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Initialize Next.js Project with Core Dependencies",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the project initialization into setup phases: project creation, dependency installation, TypeScript configuration, and project structure setup. Each subtask should focus on a specific aspect of the foundation setup.",
			"reasoning": "This is a standard project setup task with well-defined steps. The complexity is low-medium because it involves following established patterns for Next.js 14 setup. No existing codebase means this is greenfield development with clear documentation available."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Configure Supabase Integration and Authentication",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split into: Supabase project creation, database schema setup with RLS policies, Google OAuth configuration, Supabase client configuration, authentication middleware implementation, and environment setup. Each component has specific security and configuration requirements.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to database schema design, RLS policy implementation, OAuth configuration, and security considerations. Multiple integration points between Supabase, Google OAuth, and Next.js middleware require careful coordination."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Google Gemini File Search API Integration",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break into: SDK installation and configuration, FileSearchStore management, file upload streaming implementation, file validation system, error handling for API failures, file state management, and integration testing. Each aspect involves complex API interactions.",
			"reasoning": "Very high complexity due to streaming file uploads, external API integration, error handling for multiple failure modes, and file state management. Gemini API is relatively new with less community knowledge available."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Build Authentication Pages and User Management",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Organize into: login/signup UI components, AuthProvider context implementation, protected route middleware, session management utilities, and account settings page. Focus on user experience and proper state management.",
			"reasoning": "Medium complexity involving UI components, React context management, route protection, and session handling. Well-established patterns exist but requires integration with Supabase Auth and proper error handling."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Create Knowledge Base Management System",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split into: dashboard UI layout, knowledge base CRUD operations, API route implementations, limit enforcement (5 KB limit), Gemini store synchronization, and optimistic UI updates. Each component has specific business logic requirements.",
			"reasoning": "Medium-high complexity due to CRUD operations, API design, business logic for limits, external service synchronization, and UI state management. Requires coordination between database, Gemini API, and frontend state."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Implement File Upload and Management Interface",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: drag-and-drop UI implementation, file validation logic, upload progress tracking, file status management, file list UI components, deletion functionality, and error handling. Each involves complex user interactions and state management.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to drag-and-drop implementation, real-time progress tracking, file validation, state management for multiple concurrent uploads, and comprehensive error handling. Requires coordination with Gemini API."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Build AI Chat Interface with Streaming Responses",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Organize into: chat UI components, Vercel AI SDK integration, streaming response handling, message formatting, rating system implementation, error handling for chat failures, API endpoint creation, and real-time state management. This is the core feature requiring precise implementation.",
			"reasoning": "Very high complexity as this is the primary product feature. Involves real-time streaming, complex state management, integration with multiple APIs (Gemini + Vercel AI SDK), error handling for various failure modes, and sophisticated UI interactions."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Rate Limiting and Usage Controls",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split into: rate limiting middleware implementation, usage tracking database design, quota enforcement logic, usage dashboard UI, and admin monitoring utilities. Focus on scalability and accurate tracking.",
			"reasoning": "Medium-high complexity involving middleware implementation, accurate usage tracking, quota enforcement across multiple user actions, and dashboard creation. Requires careful consideration of edge cases and performance."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Create Onboarding Flow and Demo Content",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break into: onboarding tour component integration, demo knowledge base creation, empty state components, and help documentation setup. Focus on user experience and clear guidance.",
			"reasoning": "Low-medium complexity involving UI/UX components, content creation, and guided user flows. Mostly frontend work with established patterns, though requires thoughtful UX design."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Add Monitoring, Analytics, and Production Deployment",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Organize into: error tracking setup (Sentry), analytics implementation (Vercel), custom metrics dashboard, production environment configuration, CI/CD pipeline setup, and security headers configuration. Each tool requires specific configuration.",
			"reasoning": "Medium complexity involving multiple third-party integrations, production configuration, security setup, and monitoring dashboard creation. Well-documented tools but requires proper configuration and testing."
